This project is a way for me to learn a bit of Haskell.  I have implemented elliptic curve groups over (so far) finite prime fields and some basic related algorithms, includig testing using the [Haskell Test Framework](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/HTF).  I have also included a basic web interface using the [Yesod](https://yesodweb.com) web framework, which is not currently hosted anywhere but the screenshots folder contains screenshots of it running on my machine.
